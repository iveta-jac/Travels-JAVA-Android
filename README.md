## Setup

* Be aware that this project uses older technologies versions.
* Change credentials in `mobile/dbConnect.php` file.
* All the tables needed are written in the file `db.sql`. You can look at the file and create each table manually or you can just run the file with MySQL and it will create all the necessary tables automatically.
* Upload `mobile` folder (PHP files) on a host.
* Open the rest of the project with Android Studio and find and replace all `byethost` credentials.
